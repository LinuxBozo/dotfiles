# LinuxBozo's dotfiles 
* Designed with OSX in mind
* Targetted mainly toward python/groovy/grails development
* Assumes you work with git and svn

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinuxBozo/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
And definitely, you'll want to grab [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh -f
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# PATH additions
export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"

# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Mathias Bynens"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mathias@mailinator.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```
