* Targetted mainly toward python/groovy/grails development
* Assumes you work with git and svn

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinuxBozo/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh

```bash
./.osx
```
And definitely, you'll want to grab [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```
